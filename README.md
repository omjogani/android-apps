## My Journey of Building and Publishing Android Apps  

Recently, my Google Play account was shut down due to inactivity in updating my apps. Unfortunately, I missed the warning email, which led to the account's deactivation. However, here’s everything you need to know about the apps I built.  

I developed over 30 apps and successfully published two of them on the Google Play Store—**Student Mentor** and **English Mentor**, both of which were educational apps.  

### **Student Mentor**  
Student Mentor is an educational app designed for students from 1st to 12th grade, covering both Science and Commerce streams. It provides comprehensive study materials, chapter-wise textbooks for all subjects, and video tutorials organized by chapters. This all-in-one platform gives students easy access to learning resources, including over **4,500 video tutorials** and **1,500 PDF materials** to support their studies.
